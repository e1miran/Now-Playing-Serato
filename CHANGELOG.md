* Support for Icecast, enabling butt, MIXXX, Traktor,
  and many, many more.

  side benefit has been that various parts of the system
  are just generally faster, more efficient.
* Metadata processing finally got some (simple) parallelization.
* Subprocess handling is now much more streamlined.
* Moved various bits of source around in the source tree
  to ease maintenance.
* A few more things are now using pathlib.
* Better error reporting/capturing for a few things.
* A simple JSON-based source plug-in to help test things out.
* Python v3.10 is now required

## Version 3.1.2 - 2022-11-03

* Reworked filtering support to use user-supplied regular expressions.

    converted to use the new regular expression support.
* Beginning support for setlists:
  * New previoustrack template variable.
  * Example !previoustrack Twitchbot command to give users ability to
    query the track list.
  * New option to write the complete setlist to a file for either your
    own recording keeping or to share on social media or whatever.

## Version 3.1.1 - 2022-10-17

* AcoustID and MusicBrainz may now run independently! If you
  would like MB support but would like to disable AcoustID,
  please check out the new settings window.  Note that
  AcoustID requires MusicBrainz support to be turned on and
  will enforce that.
* If MusicBrainz Artist IDs are present, they will trigger
  artist website URL downloads if MusicBrainz support is enabled.
* There was a bug with enabling Artist Extras and not restarting
  causing (effectively) a hang.  Turning on Artist Extras still
  requires a restart but it should no longer crash the first
  time.
* Twitch bot messages may now be split up by using `{{ startnewmessage }}`
  as a template variable.

  unavailable/set for various types of drivers.

  also removed.

* The Qt test code got a major overhaul to improve debugging the UI.

## Version 3.1.0 - 2022-09-29

* IMPORTANT! Big Twichbot changes:

  * help, hug, and so have been removed. Removing those from your
    local install will not re-install on relaunch.
  * whatsnowplayingversion command has been added.  This command is
    a built into the source code to help with debugging
    installs. It cannot be removed or disabled.
  * A new example !artistshortbio command for the biographies
    support.
  * On startup, all of the existing twitchbot_ files will be analyzed
    and added to the preferences pane with a default of **DISABLED**.

    added while the software is running will be available immediately
    but then next startup will be disabled.

    descriptors from the track title.

  been either pulled from the tag or from external sources.
* MusicBrainz artist IDs and ISRCs are now lists of IDs. Additionally, Files
  tagged with an ISRC or MusicBrainz Recording IDs should now properly
  short-cut AcoustID DB lookups.
