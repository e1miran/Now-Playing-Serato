Welcome to What's Now Playing!
==============================

**What's Now Playing** is a tool written in Python to retrieve the current/last played
song in MIXXX, Serato, Traktor, Virtual DJ, and many other audio and DJ programs. It gives
you full control to use or not use whatever features you like and fully customize the
output to match your style. You can even pretend to be a fancy music channel:
