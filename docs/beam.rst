Two-Computer Setup With Beam
============================

  NOTE: `Requests <requests.html>`_ are currently unsupported when using **Beam**.

Previously, if you perform your DJing on one computer and your streaming from another,
you had to configure IP addresses in OBS or use file sharing (potentially with `Quirks <quirks.html>`_ enabled).

**What's Now Playing** now includes a special cut-down version of its software called **Beam**.  The
**Beam** program will transmit your DJ computer's track data to another computer running the full
**What's Now Playing** software with nearly zero special network configuration required.


Using **Beam** is simple:

1. On your DJ computer:

  #. Install and run the **Beam** program

  #. Configure your Source as you normally would

2. On your streaming computer:

  #. Install and run the full non-Beam program

  #. Configure the Source to be Beam

  #. Configure `Outputs <outputs/>`_, `Artist Extras <extras>`_, and any other network-related features

You can check the status of the connection on both sides in Settings ('Beam' on the streaming server,
'Beam Status' on the DJ computer).
