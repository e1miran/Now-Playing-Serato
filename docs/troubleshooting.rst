Troubleshooting
===============

Software is made by imperfect humans and thus tends to reflect that reality.  Here are
some tips and tricks to help you out:

* Experience has shown that starting the **What's Now Playing** app as the first piece of
  software in your stack generally results in a better experience. So, for example:

  1. **What's Now Playing**
  2. Virtual DJ
  3. OBS

  By the time OBS is up, **What's Now Playing** and your DJ software should have performed their
  housekeeping tasks.

* Be sure to remember to shut down **What's Now Playing** between sessions.  Because it hangs out
  in the menu bar, it is easy to forget it is running!

* Don't forget that there is delay from when your computer starts playing a song and
  when it finally makes it on-stream.  There are also delays between different devices
  in how the receive content.  For example, Apple TV devices may be up to a minute
  after you streamed your track!

* You do not need to be streaming to participate in your channel's Twitch chat. This
  fact means that **What's Now Playing** can be running and sending track information to
  Twitch but your users won't be alerted.  Extremely useful for working out the
  aforementioned timing issues.

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
================================

**What's Now Playing** is `open source software <https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source>`_ .
That means unlike commercial software individuals have the capability to
contribute in a variety of ways.  Currently this project is hosted
on  `Github <https://github.com/whatsnowplaying/whats-now-playing>`_ which provides
access to the source code, bugs and feature requests (issues), and a discussion
area where you can ask questions.

Keep in mind that also means this software is done by volunteers in their spare
time!
